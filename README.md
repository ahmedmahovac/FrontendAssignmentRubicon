# Instructions to run

- node_modules are not in repository, they have to be installed with "npm install"
- App can be run with "npm start"

# Implementation details worth mentioning

- I've made an assumption that top 10 movies/tv shows won't change between two consecutive app openings (so I store them locally).
- Some movies/tv shows have trailer videos which are unavailable through player (for example, youtube private videos). There isn't an easy way available to cover that case so I left it like that. 
- App si fully responsive
